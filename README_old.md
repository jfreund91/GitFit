# README

This project template includes two different project structures to choose from for your capstone.

1. mvc - For a traditional (Module 3) MVC application.
2. backend - For a web api based backend to be used alongside a vue-based frontend.

Before starting, ensure that a majority of the team has decided which project structure to use for the capstone and delete the other. 

**NOTES**

* If you pick mvc, please move the files up a level out of the mvc folder.
* If you pick web api based backend, please put the front-end code in a folder named `frontend`
* Please delete the contents of this README and replace it with your own.
